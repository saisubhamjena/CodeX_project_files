# ntroduction of Project:
CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities of India. 
Their Marketing team conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10,000 respondents.

# Task
Task is to translate these survey data into relevant insights and deliver them to the marketing team.

# Resources Provided:
📍 Dataset required to generate Insights
📍 Metadata
📍 Survey questions

# Tools Used:
⭐ ETL: Power Query
⭐ Dashboard: PowerBI
⭐ Forecasting: Excel
⭐ Data Simulation: Python
⭐ Presentation: PowerPoint
⭐ Video Editing: ClipChamp

# Methodology:

👉Step 1 (ETL): Using Power Query, import the supplied data set. In the survey table, I created a column by adding numerical values to the Consume_frequency column.

👉Step 2 (Calculation): Excel was used to compute the average consumption unit for each frequency of consumption as well as the cost of energy drink storage for retailers.

👉Step 3 (Dashboard): Create a PowerBI dashboard with our chosen KPIs and responses to all insights. Intruding buttons and bookmarks were also employed to give the dashboard a website-like feel.
Methodology:

👉Step 4 (Forecasting): To forecast profit at each price point, generate 10,000 data points on a price range using NumPy and visualise them using the Seaborn library.

👉Step 5 (Analysis): Create and run what-if scenarios in PowerBI to estimate storage costs and profits utilising PowerBI's Numeric parameter option.

⭐key Highlights: Inventory cost calculation using excel and Profit Forecasting using python.

# Solutions:
Suggested an optimal inflation-proof pricing strategy for the product to increase profit by at least 20%. Ideal product size to save storage costs so that a retailer would position our product 
in the front for maximum visibility.
